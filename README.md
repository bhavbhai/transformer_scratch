# transformer_scratch
Implemented a Transformer model from scratch in PyTorch for machine translation tasks. Specifically, the system handled source-to-target language translation, including key modules such as encoder-decoder architecture, multi-head attention, positional encoding, masking, and the full training/inference pipeline.
